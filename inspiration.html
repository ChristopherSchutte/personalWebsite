      <h5>The Three Audiences I'll Cover:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Board of Directors for Production Company</li>
        <li>Coworker over Slack</li>
        <li>Reddit Post on Data is Beautiful</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h6>Board of Directors for Production Company:</h6>
      <br>
      <p>If I were to present this information to a board of directors, there are a few important things to keep in mind. For one, the board is not going to care about how you coded it or why you did it that way, all they are going to care about is how it effects them and if the information is correct or not. Keeping those priorities in mind, I would most likely use Reveal.js but with scaled down visualizations and quick slides that mostly relied on images. The information the images or charts couldn't convey would be filled in by me, and I would use the speaker notes and romoate slide control built into Reveal to control the presentation and look at my notes. For the visualization in this presentation I would use Altair but exclude the interactive elemetns because of their issues with intigration with Reveal.</p>
      <br>
      <h6>Coworker over Slack</h6>
      <br>
      <p>For sharing some info with a coworker over slack, the vega editor link present in all Altair visualizatoins would be the best choice because the goal with sharing this information would be to show them how I did it, how easy the platform is to use, and to make sure they have full capabilities for ineraction if I built any in. This is also assuming that the coworker is more tech savvy. If they aren't as tech savvy, the best method would be to present the information in some kind of blog format and host it on a website. That way the person viewing the inforamtion will be comfortable with the format of a blog, and not have to see the code that went into making the visualization in the first place.</p>
      <br>
      <h6>Reddit Post on Data is Beautiful</h6>
      <br>
      <p>Lastly, for sharing this information with Reddit, the first thing to do is to record the interactive visualization into a GIF so that it fits well into post format and can be loaded and viewed by a variety of divices. From there, the post should have links to the github that the visulaization is stored on, as well as a website or portfolio in case you catach the eye of any potential recruiters. This is structured like this because Reddit content always needs to be esay to digest initially with the ability to deep dive if need be (at least on that subreddit). The visualization would be made in Altair, the website with bootstrap, the documentation in markup on github, and the GIF edited with Premire Pro.</p>
