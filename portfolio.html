        <h3>September, 2020</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Technical Design and Communication Course</h3>
        <br>
        <p>There were 3 main components and 1 side component that I'm attempting to get across with this logo. I wanted to show that I was from Colorado in a unique way which is why I chose to loosely trace the Sand Dunes and surrounding mountains as the centerpiece of the entire logo. 

            The second thing I wanted to show is that I have a tech-centric background and I feel the binary ring represents that well because of the auto association of Binary to computers and the way it is visually communicated I also feel scales well because the smaller it gets the more it just appears to be a border.
            
             And finally I wanted to show my experience with design which is why the logo is very heavy on the vector graphics and not just a unique representation of my name. There is a message hidden in the binary that is the first part of my favorite quote. 
            
            What I Learned: I learned that neither the binary ring or the script scaled down well to a favicon (which to me is the smallest a good logo should scale to), thus I made a revised version used in this very website.  Also if I were to do it over again I would absolutely lower the fidelity of the outline of the background mountains to increase visual consistency with the foothills and sand dunes.
