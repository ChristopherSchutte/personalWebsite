<h1>Let me introduce myself</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Christopher but you're welcome to call me Chris. I was raised in Colorado and currently live in Boulder.  
</p>
<br>
<p>Currently, I am in my third year studying Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I've managed a small business during a pandemic, taught classes of over 20 people, and have lead a project almost every semester I've been in school.
</p>
<br>
<p>In addition, I enjoy public speaking and presenting, and will gladly take on the task of explaining complicated topics to those unfamiliar with them. At nearly every job that I have, I love to be the one to fix long-standing and difficult problems and take pride in the tidiness of my workspace.
</p>
<br>
<p>There are 3 main facets to my work, data, design, and communication. These categories represent my adaptably and natural strengths so feel free to check any of those projects out. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Thanks for having a look at my portfolio and always feel free to reach out.
</p>
